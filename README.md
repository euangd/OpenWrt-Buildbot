# [OpenWrt-Buildbot](https://github.com/SuLingGG/OpenWrt-Buildbot)

## 项目介绍
1. OpenWrt firmware of arm/aarch64/x86 platform devices that provide the vast majority of source code support
2. Except for the device's default defined package, no additional packages are integrated into the firmware to ensure a pure experience.
3. Firmware is automatically compiled with source code updates every day to ensure the latest experience.
4. The software source is updated every 2 days, and there are more than 7,000 packages that can be installed in the source.
5. Provide source code package (dl) images of major OpenWrt projects/branches
6. Full-format firmware / file available (ext4/squashfs/ubi/initramfs/rootfs)
7. For advanced users, provide a complete firmware/package build tool (imagebuilder / sdk / toolchain)
8. If you want to donate this project, please move to [FUNDING.md] (https://github.com/SuLingGG/OpenWrt-Buildbot/blob/main/FUNDING.md)
